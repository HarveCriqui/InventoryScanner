# InventoryScanner
This is a personal project, designed with the aim of creating a desktop application that will allow my mother to keep track of the large amounts of toys she has collected and intends on selling. Some of the features I want to include are a working database saved to the computer, and an option to scan barcodes of new toys to make the inputting process easier.
